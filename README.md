# todo-app
My first mobile app written in React Native and Firebase :smile:. This is a todo-app for keeping track of your daily tasks. :book:
## How to run
```
git clone https://github.com/dilawarm/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
npm install
npm start
```
Open Expo Client on your device. Scan the QR code printed by `npm start` with Expo Client (Android) or Camera (iOS). You may have to wait a minute while the project bundles and loads for the first time.

Enjoy! :rocket:
